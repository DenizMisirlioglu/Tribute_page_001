            <p id="tribute-info"> <strong>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk </strong>(/ˈmʊstəfə kəˈmɑːl ˈætətɜːrk/; Turkish:
                [mustaˈfa ceˈmal aˈtatyɾc]; 19 May 1881 (conventional) – 10 November 1938) was a Turkish field marshal
                (Mareşal), revolutionary statesman, author, and founder of the Republic of Turkey, serving as its first
                President from 1923 until his death in 1938. Ideologically a secularist and nationalist, his policies
                and theories became known as Kemalism.
                <br />
                <br />
                Atatürk came to prominence for his role in securing the Ottoman Turkish victory at the Battle of
                Gallipoli (1915) during World War I. Following the Empire's defeat and subsequent dissolution, he led
                the Turkish National Movement, which resisted the mainland Turkey's partition among the victorious
                Allied powers. Establishing a provisional government in the present-day Turkish capital Ankara, he
                defeated the forces sent by the Allies, thus emerging victorious from what was later referred to as the
                Turkish War of Independence. He subsequently proceeded to abolish the decrepit Ottoman Empire and
                proclaimed the foundation of the Turkish Republic in its place.
                <br />
                <br />
                As the president of the newly formed Turkish Republic, Atatürk initiated a rigorous program of
                political, economic, and cultural reforms with the ultimate aim of building a modern, progressive, and
                secular nation-state. He made primary education free and compulsory, opening thousands of new schools
                all over the country. He also introduced the Latin-based Turkish alphabet, replacing the old Ottoman
                Turkish alphabet. Turkish women received equal civil and political rights during Atatürk's presidency
                ahead of many Western countries. In particular, women were given voting rights in local elections by Act
                no. 1580 on 3 April 1930 and a few years later, in 1934, full universal suffrage, earlier than most
                other countries in the world.
                <br />
                <br />
                His government carried out a policy of Turkicisation trying to create a homogeneous and unified nation.
                Under Atatürk, non-Turkish minorities were pressured to speak Turkish in public, non-Turkish toponyms
                and last names of minorities had to be changed to Turkish renditions. The Turkish Parliament granted him
                the surname Atatürk in 1934, which means "Father of the Turks", in recognition of the role he played in
                building the modern Turkish Republic. He died on 10 November 1938 at the age of 57 in Dolmabahçe Palace;
                he was succeeded as President by his long-time Prime Minister İsmet İnönü and was honored with a state
                funeral. In 1953, his iconic mausoleum was built and opened, which is surrounded by a park called the
                Peace Park in honor of his famous expression "Peace at Home, Peace in the World".
